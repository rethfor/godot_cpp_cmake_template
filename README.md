# Godot C++ CMake Template ‚öôÔ∏èüéÆ

A **minimal**, no-cruft template for creating a [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) project paired with a C++ [GDExtension](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdextension/index.html), built using [CMake](https://cmake.org/).

## ‚ú® Features

- üßº Clean and minimal
- üõ†Ô∏è Single-command setup for quick start
- üåç Cross-platform (tested on ü™ü Windows, üêß Linux, and üçé macOS)
- üß© [VSCode Snippets](#-vscode-snippets) for Godot boilerplate

## üöÄ Getting Started

```sh
git clone git@github.com:yehuthi/godot_cpp_cmake_template.git PROJECT_DIRECTORY
```
On **ü™ü Windows**: run [`init.ps1`](init.ps1)  
On **üêß Linux** and **üçé macOS**: run [`./init`](./init)

> [!TIP]
> The `init` script has no magic in it, it will simply ask you for a project name, get an initial build going, and do some clean-up.

üìÅ The Godot project lives in  [`game`](./game/), and the GDExtension source files live in [`src`](./src/).

### üë∑ Manual Setup

```shell
git clone git@github.com:yehuthi/godot_cpp_cmake_template.git PROJECT_DIRECTORY
cd PROJECT_DIRECTORY
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

And then to clean up:
- üóëÔ∏è Remove [`src/gdexample.cpp`](./src/gdexample.cpp), its header [`src/gdexample.hpp`](./src/gdexample.hpp), and its reference inside [`src/register_types.cpp`](./src/register_types.cpp) (though you might want to use it first to test the build works).
- üîç Find & Replace `godot_cpp_cmake_template` with your project name.
- üìù Replace this README file with your own.

## üß© VSCode Snippets

Although the goal of this template is to be minimal, it includes VSCode snippets<sup>\*</sup>.
The rationale is that deleting a top-level directory ([`.vscode`](./.vscode)) is easy and fast, and the value of good snippets in a Godot project is great, as there is a lot of ritualistic boilerplate that has nothing to do with your project, and everything to do with data plumbing between your GDExtension and the Godot Engine.

All snippets start with `gd`, so you can simply begin to type it in a C++ file to explore your options, but here's an overview:
- `gdclass`: creates a class declaration (place in `.hpp`).
  - `gdclass_impl`: implements `gdclass` methods (place in `.cpp`).
  - `gdregister`: registers your class (place in `register_types.cpp`'s `initialize_gdextension_module`).
- `gdprop`: creates a property declaration (place in `.hpp`).
  - `gdprop_impl`: implements `gdprop` declarations (place in `.cpp`).
  - `gdprop_register`: registers a property (place in `_bind_methods` in `.cpp`).
- `gdmethod`: registers a method  (place in `_bind_methods` in `.cpp`).

<hr/>

<sup>\*</sup> In the future it will be a toggle in the init script.
